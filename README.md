# Settings Management Plugin

This plugin allows administrators to configure system settings, which are normally stored somewhere in the Hippo Repository.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [bloomreach-forge.github.io/settings-management](https://bloomreach-forge.github.io/bloomreach-forge.github.io/settings-management)

The online documentation is generated by this command from the master branch:

 > mvn -Pgithub.pages clean site:site
 
The output is in the ```/docs``` directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically. 

For rendering documentation on non-master branches, use the normal site command so the output will be in the ```/target``` 
and therefore ignored by Git.

 > mvn clean site:site
