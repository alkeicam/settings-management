# Introduction

## What is the Settings management plugin?

The settings management plugin allows you to configure system settings, which are located somewhere in the Hippo Repository.
Before you would have to dive into the Hippo CMS Console and browse to a specific location to change the setting.
This plugin is targeted towards CMS admin users and webmasters, so that they can just change these settings from within the CMS UI.

## Features

This plugin for now covers only the core Hippo CMS settings. However configuration screens for other plugins can be added
to the settings management panel. See the [adding features page](adding-features.html) for more information.

## Versioning

This project uses the [Semantic Versioning Specification](http://semver.org/).

##Screenshots
